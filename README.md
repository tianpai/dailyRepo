A unified platform to discover, track, and visualize GitHub‚Äôs most popular
repositories across various categories.

DailyRepo consists of a Node.js backend that scrapes and serves trending data,
and a React/TypeScript frontend that provides an interactive dashboard for
exploring repositories by category, date, and popularity metrics.

## üìù Introduction

DailyRepo helps developers and teams stay up-to-date with the latest and
all-time trending GitHub projects. Choose from curated categories‚Äîlike Linux
utilities, AI/ML libraries, web-dev tools, productivity apps, and more‚Äîor drill
into historical trends and interactive graphs. Whether you‚Äôre scouting for
inspiration, benchmarking your own projects against the community, or simply
browsing what‚Äôs hot today, DailyRepo delivers fresh, reliable insights in an
intuitive UI.

## üöÄ Features Overview

### 1. Multi-Category Trending

- **linux-tool:** Native Linux utilities and sysadmin tools
- **cli:** Command-line applications
- **productivity:** Workflow helpers, note-taking, time tracking
- **web-dev:** Frontend, backend, and developer tooling
- **ai-ml:** AI/ML libraries, frameworks, and notebooks
- **trending:** General GitHub trending across all types
- **security:** Pen-testing, scanning, and auditing tools
- **misc:** Niche or unclassified repositories
- Default view shows **Trending**; filter by any category to narrow down results.

### 2. Powerful Scraping & Caching

- Decoupled scraping service runs on a schedule (via GitHub Actions or local scheduler).
- Pluggable cache layer (in-memory with `node-cache`, Redis-ready) for high performance and horizontal scalability.
- Extensible scoring engine merges GitHub‚Äôs metrics (stars, forks, watches) with custom weighting.

### 3. Intuitive, Interactive Frontend

- Built with **Vite**, **React** + **TypeScript**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Dynamic charts (star history, category comparisons) and pie charts for language composition.
- Light/dark mode toggle, hover animations, and a day-picker for historical views.
- Search and filtering by tags, topics, and repository name.

### 4. Deployment & DevOps

- Dockerized backend with multi-stage builds and non-root user for production readiness.
- Automated job scheduling via GitHub Actions; MongoDB Atlas integration for cloud storage.
- Environment-driven configuration with `.env` support.
